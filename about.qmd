**Adam Bunce** is completing his undergraduate honours thesis "_Curricum Requirement Planning Using Constraint Programming_".  His work models a typical undergraduate curriculum as a set of combinartoric constraints, and using a high performant SAT solver, his system allows students to interactively verify and plan out their current and future course selectors in order to satisfy various curriculum requirements as well as their own individual learning objectives.
